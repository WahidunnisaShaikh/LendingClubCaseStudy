## General Information
Understanding the factors that predict loan defaults ('charged-off') is essential for
optimizing risk management and reducing financial losses in the largest online loan marketplace.
The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 

We will work on loan data provided by consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans
to urban customers.Conducting univariate analysis to understand the
distribution and summary statistics of variables such as Loan Status, Home Ownership, Grades, Verification
Status, etc. Next, bivariate analysis will explore relationships between these variables and loan default status
('charged-off'), identifying significant correlations and trends. These insights will guide targeted strategies for
risk assessment and management based on empirical data patterns.

## Conclusions
- Manageable Risk Profile: The low default rate (14-15%) and average DTI (13.32) suggest borrowers
  are managing their debt responsibly.
- Competitive Rates: The average interest rate (12%) is attractive, potentially drawing new
  customers.
- Target Market: The data suggests loans cater to borrowers with moderate income (average Rs.
  69,000) who likely rent (living situation insight) and have varying creditworthiness (wide range of
  interest rates).
- Unverified Borrowers: The lack of verification for most loan takers highlights a potential risk
  management gap.
- Growth Potential: The dominance of low-risk Grade A & B loans alongside a presence of
  inexperienced borrowers suggests the bank is open to attracting new customer segments.
- Loan Purpose: Debt consolidation is a major loan purpose. Understanding borrower motivations
  could inform marketing strategies.
- Balancing Growth & Risk: Rising non-performing loans alongside revenue growth suggest a need for
  careful risk management during expansion.
- State Defaults: The high default rates in states with low loan volume (NE, NV) warrant further
  investigation.
